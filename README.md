# Dashboard-Final-Project

Link to deployment: https://dashboard-final-project.onrender.com/

## Description:
- This dashboard allows people to answer the question of which movies were top grossing, as well as understanding how well-received movies were based off of scores and votes.
- The audience for this particular dashboard involve people who are interested in studying popular movies of various genres in different time periods.
- My motivation behind this project lies in my interest on what kinds of movies were popular at particular time periods, which peaked my curiosity in understanding how trends vary in certain genres.
## Process:
- First, I focused on developing my user personas to understand which people will find the dashboard useful to them.
- From that point, I found a dataset that provided various different variables that are helpful in understanding what makes a movie popular.
- In designing the prototype, I first wanted to showcase the top grossing movies and organize them based off of genre and year to help the users get a first look at movies that made a lot of money.
- Another particular element I wanted to incorporate was the ability to analyze the popularity in terms of score and votes based off of other column values, and the interactive data table helps accomplish the purpose of providing more functionality to the user to understand how certain factors affect the score/votes of a movie.
- Multiple techniques were used, including the addition of a navbar with a drop down to select graph types, as well as implementing multiple different callbacks and functions to update changes made from certain parameters, which would then be translated onto the graph.
## Insights:
- My motivation for this particular topic only made me want to do more with this project, and learning the different ways in how data can be further manipulated helps in not only getting the project to a desirable state, but to also have such skills in my arsenal that I can apply to projects in the upcoming future.
